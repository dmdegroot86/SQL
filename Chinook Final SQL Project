--Here is a project regarding information about music store. It contains information on the music--
--they carry, their customers, and their employees. We came up with questions about the data that--
--we thought may be pertinent to a business or to the wants of customers. The information included--
--11 different tables with 1 or 2 common keys between them. Here is what I came up with.-- 

--What are the amount songs in each genre of music offered by the store?--

SELECT COUNT (a.GenreId) AS "Total Count", b.Name
FROM chinook.tracks a
JOIN chinook.genres b
ON a.GenreId = b.GenreId
GROUP BY b.Name
ORDER BY "Total Count" DESC;

--What is the most common city of all employees?--

SELECT COUNT(*) AS "Employees Within", City
FROM chinook.employees
GROUP BY City
ORDER BY "Employees Within" DESC
LIMIT 1;

--List all of the cities that are distinct from the customer list.--

SELECT DISTINCT City, State, Country
FROM chinook.customers
ORDER BY Country ASC, State ASC, City ASC;

--Which employees are also customers?--

SELECT a.FirstName, a.LastName
FROM chinook.customers a
JOIN chinook.employees b
ON a.FirstName = b.FirstName 
AND a.LastName = b.LastName
AND a.Address = b.Address;

--Which customers do not have an email listed?--

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Email 
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Email IS NULL;

--Which customers live outside of Canada?--

SELECT FirstName, LastName, Country
FROM chinook.customers
WHERE Country <> "Canada"
ORDER BY Country ASC;

--What if I wanted to see which customers made purchases recently, how many items they purchased, and how--
--each person spent?--

SELECT a.FirstName, a.LastName, ROUND (SUM (c.UnitPrice), 2) AS TotalSpent,  SUM (c.Quantity) AS Quantity
FROM chinook.customers a
JOIN chinook.invoices b
ON a.CustomerId = b.CustomerId
JOIN chinook.invoice_items c
ON b.InvoiceId = c.InvoiceId
GROUP BY c.InvoiceId
ORDER BY TotalSpent DESC;

--What if I wanted to see the tracks table with Album Name, Media Type, and Genre instead of number references--
--while pulling the information from multiple other tables?--

SELECT a.Name AS "Title", 
b.Name AS "Artist", 
c.Title AS "Album", 
d.Name AS "Media", 
e.Name AS "Genre",
a.UnitPrice AS "Price ($)"
FROM chinook.tracks a
JOIN chinook.artists b
JOIN chinook.albums c
JOIN chinook.media_types d
JOIN chinook.genres e
ON a.AlbumId = c.AlbumId 
AND b.ArtistId = c.ArtistId 
AND a.MediaTypeId = d.MediaTypeId 
AND a.GenreId = e.GenreId;

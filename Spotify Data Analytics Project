--During this project we were given instructions to create a table, import corresponding data, and then develop and answer--
--questions that we would like to know the answers to--

--This query is the creation of the table with the perameters used for querying the table--

CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
song_key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
song_mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness decimal(8,7) NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL );

--This query was to show that the headings had been inserted but that not table data was created with it--

SELECT *
FROM Spotifydata;

--This is where we imported the downloaded CSV data into SQL--

SELECT *
FROM Spotifydata;

--This query was to find out many artists had more than one song on the top 50 list--

SELECT artist_name, COUNT (artist_name) AS number_of_top_50_songs
FROM Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
HAVING COUNT (artist_name) > 1
ORDER BY number_of_top_50_songs DESC;

--This query was to establish the ranking in terms of popularity of all the songs in the top 50--

SELECT artist_name, track_name, popularity
FROM Spotifydata
ORDER BY popularity DESC, artist_name DESC;

--This query was to find what songs fit within a specific length range as if finding filler time--

SELECT artist_name, track_name, duration_ms
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE duration_ms >= 150000
AND duration_ms <= 200000
ORDER BY duration_ms ASC;

--This query is to determine the insturmentalness of songs where they are not 0 bt rounded to the 6th decimal point--

SELECT artist_name, track_name, ROUND (instrumentalness, 6)
FROM Spotifydata
WHERE instrumentalness <> '0'
ORDER BY instrumentalness DESC;
